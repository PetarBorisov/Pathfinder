The pathfinder is an application that aims to guide the user to choosing an eco-trail on the territory of Bulgaria. In it, you can look at one of the most famous eco-trails and also see if they are suitable for cycling, walking or other means of movement , there are also uploaded photos, you can also share your photos and comments. The application is written in Java, and HTML and CSS are often used for the frontend. I have also made a link to a database where the necessary information is stored. I use MYSQL for the database. There is also login/registration and authentication and authorization, etc.
